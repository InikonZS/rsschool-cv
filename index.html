      About me
      I've got interested in programming since childhood, took part in school olympiads.
      During my univesity graduation in electronics I always used programming for automatization 
      of all calculation. A word "solve" was equal "programm" for me, and now I have strong math 
      nd algoritmic base. My favorite language is JavaScript, also I can write C, Delphi, MatLab, 
      a little bit ASM for computer and some MCU chips. Last time I'm getting better in NodeJS, 
      WebGL, AJAX, JQuery, learning OOP and patterns, using modules, trying to write web applications. 
      Of course I know HTML and CSS, but I rather like coding JS and use HTML just like powerful 
      tool for GUI. One of succesful project was a shape generator of 3d cone slash gear for Autodesk 
      TinkerCAD, and it was added in common library.
      However I still never worked in large project, but striving for new knowledge and 
      skill of fast searching useful information is one of my strong side and I sure I can learn 
      anything fast and solve any task.
